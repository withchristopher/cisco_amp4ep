# AMP for Endpoints - Duplicate Fixer
This python script is intended to delete duplicated AMP for EndPoint hostnames.



The script executes as follows: Enter AMP4E -API Credentials -> Search all hostnames -> Create hostname duplicate list -> Query duplicate install date -> delete dated hostname. After the script runs, check AMP4E Console > Accounts > Audit Log, for changes the script performed.

Use Case: Host machine is wiped, new machine installs new AMP4EP connector. AMP4EP Console displays 2 licenses, one for wiped machine as well as new machine. Script deletes older machine based plus GUID with matching hostnames.
